# Hosting Issue Fix Plan

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update render.yml to use dynamic VITE_API_URL from the backend service
- [x] Update frontend/src/services/api.js to append '/api' to the base URL for consistency

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Make the GitHub repository public to allow Render to cache it (user action required)
